            Kinder Preschool was established in 1998 by Peter McMillan with the
            main goal of providing primary education through a stimulating
            curriculum with help from a very devoted and nurturing staff.
          </p>
          <p id="smaller">
            Our goals are accomplished through the efforts of a professional,
            caring, and dedicated staff that inspire children, involve parents
            and support colleagues, so that all children successfully achieve a
            love of learning, confidence in themselves, and respect for
            others.We always try to make our preschool an optimum environment
            for all children.
